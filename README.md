React Native Redux Fast Starter
====

This React Native starter is my own React Native starter (`iOS` and `android`).

It contains all I need or find useful most of the time to start a new mobile application.

### setup and launch

Just follow [official website instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) (*it is well documented*).

> I personally prefer running on devices but it is not a prerequisite.
