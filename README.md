React Native Redux Fast Starter
====

This React Native starter is my own React Native starter (`iOS` and `android`).

It contains all I need or find useful most of the time in a mobile application.

> Note : this repository is at early stage (*started mid-april 2016*). It will grow up fast (*I want to complete it before starting my new mobile application*).

### setup and launch

Just follow [official website instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) (*it is well documented*).

> I personally prefer running on devices but it is not a prerequisite.
